    "Abstract": "Metagenomic sequencing has allowed for the recovery of previously unexplored microbial genomes. Whereas short-read sequencing platforms often result in highly fragmented metagenomes, nanopore-based sequencers could lead to more contiguous assemblies due to their potential to generate long reads. Nevertheless, there is a lack of updated and systematic studies evaluating the performance of different assembly tools on nanopore data. In this study, we have benchmarked the ability of different assemblers to reconstruct two different commercially-available mock communities that have been sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. Among the tested tools, only metaFlye, Raven, and Canu performed well in all the datasets. These tools retrieved highly contiguous genomes (or even complete genomes) directly from the metagenomic data. Despite the intrinsic high error of nanopore sequencing, final assemblies reached high accuracy (~Ã¢â‚¬â€°99.5 to 99.8% of consensus accuracy). Polishing strategies demonstrated to be necessary for reducing the number of indels, and this had an impact on the prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters. Correction with high quality short reads did not always result in higher quality draft assemblies. Overall, nanopore metagenomic sequencing data-adapted to MinIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current output-proved sufficient for assembling and characterizing low-complexity microbial communities.",

    "Recommendations": "metaFlye could be defined as the best suited assembler for nanopore metagenomic data. This tool leads to the highest metagenome recovery ratio and performs robustly among the tested datasets. Raven also performed well and required less time to perform the analyses. Canu is more suitable when lower error rates are required, but draft assemblies should be polished in order to reduce the number of indels. Polishing with short reads does not necessarily improve the quality of the draft assemblies but, in combination with Canu, it can lead to the most accurate metagenome reconstructionÃ¢â‚¬Â"

    "Issue": "8",
    "Volume": "2138",
    "Abstract": "Background: Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be completely assembled - one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly. Methods: We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used. Results: Canu v2.0 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200119 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.0/v1.2.4 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.1.10 was the most reliable for chromosome assembly, though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.5.1 were computationally efficient but more likely to produce incomplete assemblies. Conclusions: Of the assemblers tested, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on long-read assembly algorithms.",

    "Abstract": "DNA variants represent an important source of genetic variations among individuals. Next- generation sequencing (NGS) is the most popular technology for genome-wide variant calling. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) has also recently been used in genetic studies. Although many variant callers are available, no single caller can call both types of variants on NGS or TGS data with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we systematically evaluated 11 variant callers on 12 NGS and TGS datasets. For germline variant calling, we tested DNAseq and DNAscope modes from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and WGS mode from DeepVariant. All the four callers had comparable performance on NGS data and 30Ã— coverage of WGS data was recommended. For germline variant calling on TGS data, we tested DNAseq mode from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and PACBIO mode from DeepVariant. All the three callers had similar performance in SNP calling, while DeepVariant outperformed the others in InDel calling. TGS detected more variants than NGS, particularly in complex and repetitive regions. For somatic variant calling on NGS, we tested TNscope and TNseq modes from Sentieon, MuTect2 mode from GATK, NeuSomatic, VarScan2, and Strelka2. TNscope and Mutect2 outperformed the other callers. A higher proportion of tumor sample purity (from 10 to 20%) significantly increased the recall value of calling. Finally, computational costs of the callers were compared and Sentieon required the least computational cost. These results suggest that careful selection of a tool and parameters is needed for accurate SNP or InDel calling under different scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "DNA methylation plays a fundamental role in the control of gene expression and genome integrity. Although there are multiple tools that enable its detection from Nanopore sequencing, their accuracy remains largely unknown. Here, we present a systematic benchmarking of tools for the detection of CpG methylation from Nanopore sequencing using individual reads, control mixtures of methylated and unmethylated reads, and bisulfite sequencing. We found that tools showed a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives, and presented a high dispersion with respect to the expected methylation frequency values. We described various strategies to improve the accuracy of these tools and proposed a new method, METEORE (https://github.com/comprna/METEORE), based on the combination of the predictions from two or more tools that has improved accuracy over individual tools. Snakemake pipelines are provided for reproducibility and to enable the systematic application of our analyses to other datasets.",

    "Abstract": "The development of long read sequencing (LRS) has led to greater access to the human genome. LRS produces long read lengths at the cost of high error rates and has shown to be more useful in calling structural variants than short read sequencing (SRS) data. In this paper we evaluate how to use LRS data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to call small variants in regions in- and outside the reach of SRS. Results: Calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ONT data has comparable accuracy to Illumina when evaluating against the Genome in a Bottle truth set v4.2. In the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and regions where mapping short reads is difficult, the F-measure of ONT calls exceeds those of short reads by 2-4% when sequence coverage is 20X or greater. We develop recommendations for how to perform small variant calling with LRS data and improve current approaches to the difficult regions by re-genotyping variants to increase the F-measure from 97.24% to 98.78%. Furthermore, we show how LRS can call variants in genomic regions inaccessible to SRS, including medically relevant genes such as STRC and CFC1B. Conclusions: Although small variant calling in LRS data is still immature, current methods are clearly useful in difficult and inaccessible regions of the genome, enabling variant calling in medically relevant genes not accessible to SRS.",

    "Abstract": "Shotgun metagenomics enables the reconstruction of complex microbial communities at a high level of detail. Such an approach can be conducted using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, as well as a combination of both. To assess the pros and cons of these different approaches, we used 22 faecal DNA extracts collected weekly for 11 weeks from two respective lab mice to study seven performance metrics over four combinations of sequencing depth and technology: i) 20 Gbp of Illumina short-read data, ii) 40 Gbp of short-read data, iii) 20 Gbp of PacBio HiFi long-read data, and iv) 40 Gbp of hybrid (20 Gbp of short-read + 20 Gbp of long-read) data. No strategy was best for all metrics, but instead, each one excelled across different metrics. The long-read approach yielded the best assembly statistics, with the highest N50 and lowest number of contigs. The 40 Gbp short-read approach yielded the highest number of refined bins. Finally, the hybrid approach yielded the longest assemblies, and the highest mapping rate to the bacterial genomes. Our results suggest that while long-read sequencing significantly improves the quality of reconstructed bacterial genomes, it is more expensive and requires deeper sequencing than short-read approaches to recover a comparable amount of reconstructed genomes. The most optimal strategy is study-specific, and depends on how researchers assess the tradeoff between the quantity and quality of recovered genomes.",

Whole-genome sequencing is a popular approach for identifying structural variants, but the accuracy of popular tools remains unclear due to the limitations of existing benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of these tools for predicting variants in non-human genomes is less certain, as most tools were developed and benchmarked using data from the human genome. To evaluate the use of long-read data for the validation of short-read structural variant calls, the agreement between predictions from a short-read ensemble learning method and long-read tools were compared using real and simulated data from Caenorhabditis elegans. The results obtained from simulated data indicate that the best performing tool is contingent on the type and size of the variant, as well as the sequencing depth of coverage.

    "Journal": "bioRxiv",
    "Abstract": "Advances in long-read sequencing (LRS) technology continue to make whole-genome sequencing more complete, affordable, and accurate. LRS provides significant advantages over short-read sequencing approaches, including phased de novo genome assembly, access to previously excluded genomic regions, and discovery of more complex structural variants (SVs) associated with disease. Limitations remain with respect to cost, scalability, and platform-dependent read accuracy and the tradeoffs between sequence coverage and sensitivity of variant discovery are important experimental considerations for the application of LRS. We compare the genetic variant calling precision and recall of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio HiFi platforms over a range of sequence coverages. For read-based applications, LRS sensitivity begins to plateau around 12-fold coverage with a majority of variants called with reasonable accuracy (F1 score above 0.5), and both platforms perform well for SV detection. Genome assembly increases variant calling precision and recall of SVs and indels in HiFi datasets with HiFi outperforming ONT in quality as measured by the F1 score of assembly-based variant callsets. While both technologies continue to evolve, our work offers guidance to design cost-effective experimental strategies that do not compromise on discovering novel biology.",

If the goal is recovery and characterization of SNVs at a population scale, low-depth read-based methods will provide the right balance of maximizing discovery and number of samples in the study. However, if the goal is sequence resolution of large and complex variants at the level of individual patients, assembly-based methods, in particular hifiasm, are currently one of the most accurate strategies for building phased genome assemblies but require greater investment in terms of sequence coverage (well beyond 15X) and computational processing."

    "Abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been increasingly recognized as a new and important regulator of gene expression. To date, transcriptome-wide m6A detection primarily relies on well-established methods using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. However, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform has recently emerged as a promising alternative method to study m6A. While multiple computational tools are being developed to facilitate the direct detection of nucleotide modifications, little is known about the capabilities and limitations of these tools. Here, we systematically compare ten tools used for mapping m6A from ONT DRS data. We find that most tools present a trade-off between precision and recall, and integrating results from multiple tools greatly improve performance. Using a negative control could improve precision by subtracting certain intrinsic bias. We also observed variation in detection capabilities and quantitative information among motifs, and identified sequencing depth and m6A stoichiometry as potential factors affecting performance. Our study provides insight into the computational tools currently used for mapping m6A based on ONT DRS data and highlights the potential for further improving these tools, which may serve as the basis for future research.",

    "Recommendations": "m6Anet, xPore and Nanocompore achieved the highest precision at the cost of lowest recall, while Tombo and Tombo_com achieved the opposite. Nevertheless, integrated predictions from all tools achieved better performance than individual tools, especially when using m6A sites which were supported by multiple tools (>4). As for quantitation, methylation rates reported by Tombo/Tombo_com, Nanom6A and xPore showed positive correlation to the enrichment score determined by MeRIP-seq, but were poorly agreed across ONT tools or with the methylation rates quantified by m6A-REF-seq. Taken together, there is still room for improvement in the algorithms for the identification and quantification of RNA modifications from ONT DRS datasets."

    "Abstract": "Assembly algorithm choice should be a deliberate, well-justified decision when researchers create genome assemblies for eukaryotic organisms from third-generation sequencing technologies. While third-generation sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) have overcome the disadvantages of short read lengths specific to next-generation sequencing (NGS), third-generation sequencers are known to produce more error-prone reads, thereby generating a new set of challenges for assembly algorithms and pipelines. Since the introduction of third-generation sequencing technologies, many tools have been developed that aim to take advantage of the longer reads, and researchers need to choose the correct assembler for their projects.",

    "Journal": "Research Square",
    "Abstract": "The advent of third-generation sequencing and particularly long-read sequencing, which produces contiguous DNA fragments thousands of bases long, can greatly improve diploid genome assembly and detection of structural variants (SVs), in principle. With long-read whole genome sequencing data becoming increasingly available, designing efficient and reliable algorithms to identify SVs is critical. As a result, a plethora of SV callers have been recently developed to identify SVs. Alignment-based approaches are most popular because they are less computationally demanding and require substantially less sequencing coverage. Alternative approaches assembling the whole genome based on available reads alone (de novo assembly) and comparing assemblies to the reference genome with assembly-based tools to detect SVs, are much more demanding in data coverage and computational resources. However, the lack of comprehensive benchmarking limits our understanding of these two general approaches and hampers further algorithm development. Here we systematically compared 12 read alignment-based SV callers, and 4 assembly-based SV callers, along with 4 upstream aligners and 7 assemblers based on a rigorous and comprehensive benchmarking design. We provide performance results of these tools for different sizes of SVs, insertions vs. deletions, criteria for breakpoint and novel sequence detection, and alignment-based strategy vs. assembly-based strategies under different evaluation scenarios. Based on these results, we offer guidelines and recommendations for different tools and directions for further method development.",

    "Recommendations": "The SV calling performance of assembly-based tools did not diminish significantly until se-quencing coverage dropped to 10x or less. Our analysisfor assembly break in HifiL1 suggests that the assem-bly quality is worse at low coverage (e.g. 20x) versushigh coverage (e.g. 50x), and it influences genotypeaccuracy the most."

In comparison, a prior study [35] showed that vg and paragraph, two SRS-based methods, genotyped 88.76% (11,313 of 12,745) and 93.17% (11,874 of 12,745). In addition, we found 10,074 consistent genotypes for cuteSV, LRcaller, and Tier 1 SVs of HG002, which is higher than the number (6612) between vg [23] and paragraph [22], suggesting a better congruence of LRS-based genotyping methods than the SRS-based methods."

    "Abstract": "Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly polymorphic in the human genome, have thousands of associated molecular traits, and are linked to over 60 disease phenotypes. However, their complexity often excludes them from at-scale studies due to challenges with variant calling, representation, and lack of a genome-wide standard. To promote TR methods development, we create a comprehensive catalog of TR regions and explore its properties across 86 samples. We then curate variants from the GIAB HG002 individual to create a tandem repeat benchmark. We also present a variant comparison method that handles small and large alleles and varying allelic representation. The 8.1% of the genome covered by the TR catalog holds _24.9% of variants per individual, including 124,728 small and 17,988 large variants for the GIAB HG002 TR benchmark. We work with the GIAB community to demonstrate the utility of this benchmark across short and long read technologies.",
