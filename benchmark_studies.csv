Assembly methods for nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing: a comparative study,"Adriel Latorre-Prez, Pascual Villalba-Bermell, Javier Pascual, Cristina Vilanova",2020,Scientific Reports,10,13588,"Metagenomic sequencing has allowed for the recovery of previously unexplored microbial genomes. Whereas short-read sequencing platforms often result in highly fragmented metagenomes, nanopore-based sequencers could lead to more contiguous assemblies due to their potential to generate long reads. Nevertheless, there is a lack of updated and systematic studies evaluating the performance of different assembly tools on nanopore data. In this study, we have benchmarked the ability of different assemblers to reconstruct two different commercially-available mock communities that have been sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. Among the tested tools, only metaFlye, Raven, and Canu performed well in all the datasets. These tools retrieved highly contiguous genomes (or even complete genomes) directly from the metagenomic data. Despite the intrinsic high error of nanopore sequencing, final assemblies reached high accuracy (~â€‰99.5 to 99.8% of consensus accuracy). Polishing strategies demonstrated to be necessary for reducing the number of indels, and this had an impact on the prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters. Correction with high quality short reads did not always result in higher quality draft assemblies. Overall, nanopore metagenomic sequencing data-adapted to MinIONâ€™s current output-proved sufficient for assembling and characterizing low-complexity microbial communities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70491-3,Oxford Nanopore,"Metagenomics, DenovoAssembly","MetaSpades, Megahit, Minia, Canu, HINGE, Miniasm, MetaFlye, Promoxis, Raven, Redbean, Shasta, Unicycler",mock communities sequenced on GridION and PromethION (Nicholls et al. PRJEB29504),"metaFlye could be defined as the best suited assembler for nanopore metagenomic data. This tool leads to the highest metagenome recovery ratio and performs robustly among the tested datasets. Raven also performed well and required less time to perform the analyses. Canu is more suitable when lower error rates are required, but draft assemblies should be polished in order to reduce the number of indels. Polishing with short reads does not necessarily improve the quality of the draft assemblies but, in combination with Canu, it can lead to the most accurate metagenome reconstructionâ€"
Benchmarking of long-read assemblers for prokaryote whole genome sequencing,"Ryan R. Wick, Kathryn E. Holt",2020,f1000Research,8,2138,"Background: Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be completely assembled - one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly. Methods: We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used. Results: Canu v2.0 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200119 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.0/v1.2.4 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.1.10 was the most reliable for chromosome assembly, though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.5.1 were computationally efficient but more likely to produce incomplete assemblies. Conclusions: Of the assemblers tested, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on long-read assembly algorithms.",https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.21782.3,"Oxford Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences",DenovoAssembly,"Canu, Flye, MiniasmMinipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta",500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets of microbial genomes,"Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish and Raven performed best overall. Yet there was no individual tool that could perform well on all metrics. Therefore, continued development on long-read assembly algorithms is still needed."
Benchmarking variant callers in next-generation and third-generation sequencing analysis,"Surui Pei, Tao Liu, Xue Ren, Weizhong Li, Chongjian Chen, Zhi Xie",2020,Briefings in Bioinformatics,bbaa,148,"DNA variants represent an important source of genetic variations among individuals. Next- generation sequencing (NGS) is the most popular technology for genome-wide variant calling. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) has also recently been used in genetic studies. Although many variant callers are available, no single caller can call both types of variants on NGS or TGS data with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we systematically evaluated 11 variant callers on 12 NGS and TGS datasets. For germline variant calling, we tested DNAseq and DNAscope modes from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and WGS mode from DeepVariant. All the four callers had comparable performance on NGS data and 30× coverage of WGS data was recommended. For germline variant calling on TGS data, we tested DNAseq mode from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and PACBIO mode from DeepVariant. All the three callers had similar performance in SNP calling, while DeepVariant outperformed the others in InDel calling. TGS detected more variants than NGS, particularly in complex and repetitive regions. For somatic variant calling on NGS, we tested TNscope and TNseq modes from Sentieon, MuTect2 mode from GATK, NeuSomatic, VarScan2, and Strelka2. TNscope and Mutect2 outperformed the other callers. A higher proportion of tumor sample purity (from 10 to 20%) significantly increased the recall value of calling. Finally, computational costs of the callers were compared and Sentieon required the least computational cost. These results suggest that careful selection of a tool and parameters is needed for accurate SNP or InDel calling under different scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa148,"Illumina, Pacific Biosciences",SNPAndVariantAnalysis,"Sentieon, DeepVariant, GATK HaplotypeCaller, NeuSomatic, VarScan2, Strelka2","The sample HG001 was a B lymphocyte cell line from a woman of Utah's CEPH lineage.

Systematic benchmarking of tools for CpG methylation detection from Nanopore sequencing,"Zaka Wing-Sze Yuen, Akanksha Srivastava, Dennis McNevin, Cameron Jack, Eduardo Eyras",2020,bioRxiv,,,"DNA methylation plays a fundamental role in the control of gene expression and genome integrity. Although there are multiple tools that enable its detection from Nanopore sequencing, their accuracy remains largely unknown. Here, we present a systematic benchmarking of tools for the detection of CpG methylation from Nanopore sequencing using individual reads, control mixtures of methylated and unmethylated reads, and bisulfite sequencing. We found that tools showed a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives, and presented a high dispersion with respect to the expected methylation frequency values. We described various strategies to improve the accuracy of these tools and proposed a new method, METEORE (https://github.com/comprna/METEORE), based on the combination of the predictions from two or more tools that has improved accuracy over individual tools. Snakemake pipelines are provided for reproducibility and to enable the systematic application of our analyses to other datasets.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.340315,Oxford Nanopore,BaseModificationDetection,"Nanopolish, Tombo, DeepSignal, Megalodon, Guppy, DeepMod","Nanopore sequencing fast5 files of individual reads, controlled methylation mixtures, Cas9-targeted sequencing, and whole genome bisulfite sequencing","In general, the tested tools present a trade-off between true positives and false positives, and a high dispersion in the prediction of methylation frequencies.

Benchmarking small variant detection with ONT reveals high performance in challenging regions ,"Peter L. Møller, Guillaume Holley, Doruk Beyter, Mette Nyegaard, Bjarni V. Halldórsson",2020,bioRxiv,,,"Background: The development of long read sequencing (LRS) has led to greater access to the human genome. LRS produces long read lengths at the cost of high error rates and has shown to be more useful in calling structural variants than short read sequencing (SRS) data. In this paper we evaluate how to use LRS data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to call small variants in regions in- and outside the reach of SRS. Results: Calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ONT data has comparable accuracy to Illumina when evaluating against the Genome in a Bottle truth set v4.2. In the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and regions where mapping short reads is difficult, the F-measure of ONT calls exceeds those of short reads by 2-4% when sequence coverage is 20X or greater. We develop recommendations for how to perform small variant calling with LRS data and improve current approaches to the difficult regions by re-genotyping variants to increase the F-measure from 97.24% to 98.78%. Furthermore, we show how LRS can call variants in genomic regions inaccessible to SRS, including medically relevant genes such as STRC and CFC1B. Conclusions: Although small variant calling in LRS data is still immature, current methods are clearly useful in difficult and inaccessible regions of the genome, enabling variant calling in medically relevant genes not accessible to SRS.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.350009,"Oxford Nanopore, Illumina",SNPAndVariantAnalysis,"Clair, Medaka, PEPPER","GRCh38 aligned Illumina BAM files from the Ashkenazim trio (HG002, HG003, HG004), ONT and PacBio HiFi FASTQ files were downloaded and aligned to GRCh38","In the challenging regions of the genome, ONT outperforms short read sequensing in SNP calling such as the MHC.
