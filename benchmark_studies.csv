Assembly methods for nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing: a comparative study,"Adriel Latorre-Prez, Pascual Villalba-Bermell, Javier Pascual, Cristina Vilanova",2020,Scientific Reports,10,13588,"Metagenomic sequencing has allowed for the recovery of previously unexplored microbial genomes. Whereas short-read sequencing platforms often result in highly fragmented metagenomes, nanopore-based sequencers could lead to more contiguous assemblies due to their potential to generate long reads. Nevertheless, there is a lack of updated and systematic studies evaluating the performance of different assembly tools on nanopore data. In this study, we have benchmarked the ability of different assemblers to reconstruct two different commercially-available mock communities that have been sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. Among the tested tools, only metaFlye, Raven, and Canu performed well in all the datasets. These tools retrieved highly contiguous genomes (or even complete genomes) directly from the metagenomic data. Despite the intrinsic high error of nanopore sequencing, final assemblies reached high accuracy (~√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞99.5 to 99.8% of consensus accuracy). Polishing strategies demonstrated to be necessary for reducing the number of indels, and this had an impact on the prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters. Correction with high quality short reads did not always result in higher quality draft assemblies. Overall, nanopore metagenomic sequencing data-adapted to MinION√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s current output-proved sufficient for assembling and characterizing low-complexity microbial communities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70491-3,Oxford Nanopore,"Metagenomics, DenovoAssembly","MetaSpades, Megahit, Minia, Canu, HINGE, Miniasm, MetaFlye, Promoxis, Raven, Redbean, Shasta, Unicycler",mock communities sequenced on GridION and PromethION (Nicholls et al.

This tool leads to the highest metagenome recovery ratio and performs robustly among the tested datasets. Raven also performed well and required less time to perform the analyses. Canu is more suitable when lower error rates are required, but draft assemblies should be polished in order to reduce the number of indels. Polishing with short reads does not necessarily improve the quality of the draft assemblies but, in combination with Canu, it can lead to the most accurate metagenome reconstruction√¢‚Ç¨¬ù"
Benchmarking of long-read assemblers for prokaryote whole genome sequencing,"Ryan R. Wick, Kathryn E. Holt",2020,f1000Research,8,2138,"Background: Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be completely assembled - one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly. Methods: We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational resources used. Results: Canu v2.0 produced reliable assemblies and was good with plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200119 was reliable and good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.0/v1.2.4 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.1.10 was the most reliable for chromosome assembly, though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.5.1 were computationally efficient but more likely to produce incomplete assemblies. Conclusions: Of the assemblers tested, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on long-read assembly algorithms.",https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.21782.3,"Oxford Nanopore,Pac Bio",DenovoAssembly,"Canu, Flye, MiniasmMinipolish, NECAT, NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta",500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets of microbial genomes,"Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish and Raven performed best overall.

Benchmarking variant callers in next-generation and third-generation sequencing analysis,"Surui Pei, Tao Liu, Xue Ren, Weizhong Li, Chongjian Chen, Zhi Xie",2020,Briefings in Bioinformatics,NA,148,"DNA variants represent an important source of genetic variations among individuals. Next- generation sequencing (NGS) is the most popular technology for genome-wide variant calling. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) has also recently been used in genetic studies. Although many variant callers are available, no single caller can call both types of variants on NGS or TGS data with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we systematically evaluated 11 variant callers on 12 NGS and TGS datasets. For germline variant calling, we tested DNAseq and DNAscope modes from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and WGS mode from DeepVariant. All the four callers had comparable performance on NGS data and 30√ó coverage of WGS data was recommended. For germline variant calling on TGS data, we tested DNAseq mode from Sentieon, HaplotypeCaller mode from GATK and PACBIO mode from DeepVariant. All the three callers had similar performance in SNP calling, while DeepVariant outperformed the others in InDel calling. TGS detected more variants than NGS, particularly in complex and repetitive regions. For somatic variant calling on NGS, we tested TNscope and TNseq modes from Sentieon, MuTect2 mode from GATK, NeuSomatic, VarScan2, and Strelka2. TNscope and Mutect2 outperformed the other callers. A higher proportion of tumor sample purity (from 10 to 20%) significantly increased the recall value of calling. Finally, computational costs of the callers were compared and Sentieon required the least computational cost. These results suggest that careful selection of a tool and parameters is needed for accurate SNP or InDel calling under different scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa148,"Illumina,Pac Bio",SNPAndVariantAnalysis,"Sentieon, DeepVariant, GATK HaplotypeCaller, NeuSomatic, VarScan2, Strelka2","The sample HG001 was a B lymphocyte cell line from a woman of Utah's CEPH lineage.

Benchmarking small variant detection with ONT reveals high performance in challenging regions ,"Peter L. Moller , Guillaume Holley , Doruk Beyter , Mette Nyegaard, Bjarni V. Halldorsson",2020,bioRxiv,NA,NA,"The development of long read sequencing (LRS) has led to greater access to the human genome. LRS produces long read lengths at the cost of high error rates and has shown to be more useful in calling structural variants than short read sequencing (SRS) data. In this paper we evaluate how to use LRS data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to call small variants in regions in- and outside the reach of SRS. Results: Calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ONT data has comparable accuracy to Illumina when evaluating against the Genome in a Bottle truth set v4.2. In the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and regions where mapping short reads is difficult, the F-measure of ONT calls exceeds those of short reads by 2-4% when sequence coverage is 20X or greater. We develop recommendations for how to perform small variant calling with LRS data and improve current approaches to the difficult regions by re-genotyping variants to increase the F-measure from 97.24% to 98.78%. Furthermore, we show how LRS can call variants in genomic regions inaccessible to SRS, including medically relevant genes such as STRC and CFC1B. Conclusions: Although small variant calling in LRS data is still immature, current methods are clearly useful in difficult and inaccessible regions of the genome, enabling variant calling in medically relevant genes not accessible to SRS.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.350009,"Oxford Nanopore,Illumina",SNPAndVariantAnalysis,"Clair, Medaka, PEPPER","GRCh38 aligned Illumina BAM files from the Ashkenazim trio (HG002, HG003, HG004), ONT and PacBio HiFi FASTQ files were downloaded and aligned to GRCh38","In the challenging regions of the genome, ONT outperforms short read sequensing in SNP calling such as the MHC.

Such an approach can be conducted using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, as well as a combination of both. To assess the pros and cons of these different approaches, we used 22 faecal DNA extracts collected weekly for 11 weeks from two respective lab mice to study seven performance metrics over four combinations of sequencing depth and technology: i) 20 Gbp of Illumina short-read data, ii) 40 Gbp of short-read data, iii) 20 Gbp of PacBio HiFi long-read data, and iv) 40 Gbp of hybrid (20 Gbp of short-read + 20 Gbp of long-read) data. No strategy was best for all metrics, but instead, each one excelled across different metrics. The long-read approach yielded the best assembly statistics, with the highest N50 and lowest number of contigs. The 40 Gbp short-read approach yielded the highest number of refined bins. Finally, the hybrid approach yielded the longest assemblies, and the highest mapping rate to the bacterial genomes. Our results suggest that while long-read sequencing significantly improves the quality of reconstructed bacterial genomes, it is more expensive and requires deeper sequencing than short-read approaches to recover a comparable amount of reconstructed genomes.

As a result, a plethora of SV callers have been recently developed to identify SVs. Alignment-based approaches are most popular because they are less computationally demanding and require substantially less sequencing coverage. Alternative approaches assembling the whole genome based on available reads alone (de novo assembly) and comparing assemblies to the reference genome with assembly-based tools to detect SVs, are much more demanding in data coverage and computational resources.

In addition, we found 10,074 consistent genotypes for cuteSV, LRcaller, and Tier 1 SVs of HG002, which is higher than the number (6612) between vg [23] and paragraph [22], suggesting a better congruence of LRS-based genotyping methods than the SRS-based methods."

Benchmarking of computational methods for m6A profiling with Nanopore direct RNA sequencing,"Simone Maestri, Mattia Furlan, Logan Mulroney, Lucia Coscujuela Tarrero, Camilla Ugolini, Fabio Dalla Pozza, Tommaso Leonardi, Ewan Birney, Francesco Nicassio, Mattia Pelizzola",2024,Briefings in Bioinformatics,2,25,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal eukaryotic mRNA modification, and is involved in the regulation of various biological processes. Direct Nanopore sequencing of native RNA (dRNA-seq) emerged as a leading approach for its identification. Several software were published for m6A detection and there is a strong need for independent studies benchmarking their performance on data from different species, and against various reference datasets. Moreover, a computational workflow is needed to streamline the execution of tools whose installation and execution remains complicated. We developed NanOlympicsMod, a Nextflow pipeline exploiting containerized technology for comparing 14 tools for m6A detection on dRNA-seq data. NanOlympicsMod was tested on dRNA-seq data generated from in vitro (un)modified synthetic oligos. The m6A hits returned by each tool were compared to the m6A position known by design of the oligos. In addition, NanOlympicsMod was used on dRNA-seq datasets from wild-type and m6A-depleted yeast, mouse and human, and each tool’s hits were compared to reference m6A sets generated by leading orthogonal methods. The performance of the tools markedly differed across datasets, and methods adopting different approaches showed different preferences in terms of precision and recall. Changing the stringency cut-offs allowed for tuning the precision-recall trade-off towards user preferences. Finally, we determined that precision and recall of tools are markedly influenced by sequencing depth, and that additional sequencing would likely reveal additional m6A sites. Thanks to the possibility of including novel tools, NanOlympicsMod will streamline the benchmarking of m6A detection tools on dRNA-seq data, improving future RNA modification characterization.",https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbae001,Oxford Nanopore,BaseModificationDetection,"Tombo, Yanocomp, Nanocompore ,XPore, ELIGOS, DiffErr, NanoDoc, DRUMMER, EpiNano-Error, EpiNano-SVM, Nanom6A, M6Anet, MINES, DENA","Nanopore dRNA, HEK293T cells, SK1 yeast strain, mouse.

Benchmarking reveals superiority of deep learning variant callers on bacterial nanopore sequence data,"Michael B. Hall, Ryan R. Wick, Louise M. Judd, An N. T. Nguyen, Eike J.

Coin",2024,bioRxiv,NA,NA,"Variant calling is fundamental in bacterial genomics, underpinning the identification of disease transmission clusters, the construction of phylogenetic trees, and antimicrobial resistance prediction. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking of SNP and indel variant calling accuracy across 14 diverse bacterial species using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Illumina sequencing. We generate gold standard reference genomes and project variations from closelyrelated strains onto them, creating biologically realistic distributions of SNPs and indels.Our results demonstrate that ONT variant calls from deep learning-based tools delivered higher SNP and indel accuracy than traditional methods and Illumina, with Clair3 providing the most accurate results overall. We investigate the causes of missed and false calls, highlighting the limitations inherent in short reads and discover that ONT’s traditional limitations with homopolymerinduced indel errors are absent with high-accuracy basecalling models and deep learning-based variant calls. Furthermore, our findings on the impact of read depth on variant calling offer valuable insights for sequencing projects with limited resources, showing that 10x depth is sufficient to achieve variant calls that match or exceed Illumina.In conclusion, our research highlights the superior accuracy of deep learning tools in SNP and indel detection with ONT sequencing, challenging the primacy of short-read sequencing. The reduction of systematic errors and the ability to attain high accuracy at lower read depths enhance the viability of ONT for widespread use in clinical and public health bacterial genomics.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.15.585313,Oxford Nanopore,SNPAndVariantAnalysis,"BCFtools, Clair3, DeppVariant, FreeBayes, Longshot, NanoCaller","Baceria WGS on nanopore with variant truthset, and complimentary illumina data",Long read data analysed with Clari3 or DeepVariant were evaluated as the best tools compared to others

However, the computational analysis of long read RNA sequencing data remains challenging as it is difficult to disentangle technical artifacts from bona fide biological information. To address this, we evaluated the performance of multiple leading transcriptome assembly algorithms on their ability to accurately reconstruct RNA transcript isoforms. We specifically focused on deep nanopore sequencing of synthetic RNA spike-in controls (Sequins™ and SIRVs) across different chemistries, including cDNA and direct RNA protocols. Our systematic comparative benchmarking exposes the strengths and limitations of the different surveyed strategies.
